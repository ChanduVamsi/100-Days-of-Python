Implementation of the pong game will be divided into x steps. The steps are as follows:

1. Setup the screen - horizontal dotted line
2. Setup the rackets on either side
3. Make the rackets move as per keyboard inputs
4. Create a ball that continuosly moves
5. Detect collision with above and below walls and bounce the ball
5. Detect collision with the rackets and hit the ball
6. Create a scoreboard and keep updating the score board
7. Detect when either of the rackets miss the ball and update the score
8. When the ball goes off the table, make a new serve until either of scores is equal to 3
