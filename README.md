Hi there. I've embarked on this remarkable journey of learning and applying python. I'll follow the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" course on Udemy by Dr Angela Yu. Link for the same: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/.

I'll update this repository with new projects regularly as I keep learning more and more concepts. I am so pumped to start this journey and get hands-on with it. I suggest you enrol in on the same course if you're looking to learn python and don't know where to start.

I hereby declare the credit for all the project ideas in this repository goes to Dr Angela Yu and her team. I have just implemented the learnings and project ideas she has provided in the course.

A small word to my fellow developers - Stay Relentlessâš¡
