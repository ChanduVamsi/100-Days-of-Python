Hi there. I've embarked myself on this amazing journey of learning and applying python. I'll be following "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. Link for the same: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/. 

I'll be updating this repository with new projects on a regular basis as I keep learning more and more concepts. I am so pumped to start this journey and get hands on with it. I strongly suggest you to take the same course as well if you're looking to learn python and don't know where to start. 

I hereby declare the credit for all the projects ideas in this repository goes to Dr. Angela Yu and her team. I have just implemented the learnings and project ideas she have provided on the course. 

A small word to my fellow developers - Stay Relentlessâš¡
