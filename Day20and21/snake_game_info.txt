Implementation of the snake game will be divided among 2 days and an overall of 7 steps. The steps are as follows:

Day 20 - Steps 1, 2, 3
1. Create a snake body - initially the snake is of length 3
2. Move the snake - continously moves forwards
3. Control the snake - make it change direction using keyboard controls
